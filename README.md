# ⚡ Arduino Project — Wokwi & Hardware Ready

This repository contains Arduino-based projects that can be tested directly in the [Wokwi Simulator](https://wokwi.com) and on real hardware.  
It is designed for learning, prototyping, and experimenting with embedded systems.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Compatible with **Wokwi Simulator** (run online, no hardware required).
- Ready to upload and test on **real Arduino boards**.
- Modular code structure for easy customization.
- Includes configuration files (`diagram.json`, `wokwi.toml`, etc.) for simulation.

---

## 🛠 Requirements
To run these projects locally or on hardware, make sure you have:

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
- A supported Arduino board (e.g., **Arduino Uno, Nano, Mega**)
- Required libraries (listed in each project’s `.ino` file)
- For simulation:  
  - A free [Wokwi account](https://wokwi.com)

---

## ▶️ How to Run in Wokwi
1. Open the project folder.
2. Upload the `.ino` file and related configuration files (`diagram.json`, `wokwi.toml`) to [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com).
3. Click **Run** to simulate the circuit.

---

## 🔌 How to Run on Real Hardware
1. Connect your Arduino board via USB.
2. Open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE.
3. Select the correct **Board** and **Port** in IDE.
4. Click **Upload**.
5. Connect the required components (refer to `diagram.json` for wiring).
6. Enjoy running the project on actual hardware.
